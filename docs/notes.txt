Building UV-CDAT
-----------------------------

This is the path!
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Applications/CMake_2.8-12.app/Contents/bin

symlinked /usr/local/bin/gfortran to /usr/bin

[https://github.com/UV-CDAT/uvcdat/wiki/Building-UVCDAT]
git clone uvcdat (and uvcdat-devel, see instructions on website)
mkdir uvcdat-build
cd uvcdat-build
ccmake ../uvcdat
set http:// for git protocol (if inside the lab)
c, c, c, g
make -j8

source ./install/bin/setup_runtime.sh

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#dumps all output to console
./install/bin/uvcdat --output=""

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------
ViSUS Installation
-----------------------------

Build visuspy:
export PATH=/Users/cam/code/uvcdat-build/install/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:$PATH
ccmake -DVISUS_SWIG=YES ../..
(NOTE: Still had to manually change PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR and PYTHON_LIBRARY to point to the correct places in the uvcdat installation)


#Install visuspy to <uvcdat_install>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages
<visus>/visuscpp/swig/installpy.sh /Users/cam/code/uvcdat-build/install/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages

mkpy.sh
testpy.sh
installpy.sh

***
UPDATE: scripts will now automatically find python location, so do this:
 (*no they won't, must manually set PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR and PYTHON_LIBRARY)
***

source ~/code/uvcdat-build/install/bin/setup_runtime.sh

ccmake -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/Users/cam/code/uvcdat-build/install/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/Users/cam/code/uvcdat-build/install/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/libpython2.7.dylib -DVISUS_SWIG=YES ../..
make -j12
../../visuscpp/swig/installpy.sh

[ ] cron script to monitor directory and restart server if a new idx file appears
[x] script to create initial tables in idx.db
[ ] xml_to_idx script to create idx and populate idx.db tables
[ ] converter app (can be part of server, facilitates Timo's way) to convert a var at a timestep upon request
[ ] server modified to check idx.db to see if a variable has already been converted (not final solution)

[ ] for conversion, may not need to use db. Also, cdms2 basically eats that xml file and takes care of everything.

We have not really created a suitable mapping from cdat datasets to idx volumes. Most datasets contain fiends from many different domains, which require separate idx volumes. It is necessary to adopt a standard naming scheme that is clear, related to the original dataset(s), and as simple as possible. We also need an interface on the reader side to list the variables of a dataset since seemingly related variables may be in different domains ("plev lat lon" vs "lev lat lon") even though the domains are the same size. We can choose to identify datasets only by their shape, but then we are throwing away information (plev vs lev) that may be critical for rendering and analysis.
