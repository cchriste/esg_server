o map-reduce operations (Daniel Duffy from NASA presented)
  - converting data on the fly for
  - example: find max temp over some time period
     + we could accomplish the same using max filter and visus

o we are missing the ability to operate on temporal data, which is critical for climate science

o UV-CDAT (presented by Charles Doutrieux)
  - many regridders in UV-CDAT, most important being "ESMF"
  - uv-cdat "live" thin web client

35-50Tb cache on css2
ESGF conversion node

Dean wants a prototype: 

three components to incorporate with UV-CDAT
 o download/find visus python installation
 o code to integrate visus (python)
 o ctest to ensure it works


Charles advises not to worry about hooking into any vistrails
provenance since it's all broken anyway. They're working on a
replacement.

With Timo and Giorgio

o Need to get ESGF account
o Dean can show me how to access the data using the EGF api
o vision is to use ViSUS as an exploratory front end to look at data, then finally save current state for final conversion
o milestone 0: figure out how to list datasets from uv-cdat
o milestone 1: figure out opendap interface
o milestone 2: wrap that and implement in the esg server
o milestone 3: create on-the-fly conversion to idx
o milestone 4: get a visus server running at livermore
o milestone 5: manage cache in a sane fashion
o milestone 6: 

o overview goal: a request for cdat data comes into the visus server running with the the esg node, gets converted to idx on the fly, and is served.
